# webxr-typescript

TypeScript definitions for the [WebXR Device API](https://immersive-web.github.io/webxr/).

## This is a Temporary Repo

My intention is to submit a PR to [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped) once this is complete, so that it can be installed with:

```
npm install --save-dev @types/webxr
```

## Remaining issues

- DOMString: This is not a string
- There are several array-like types that are here typed just as arrays
